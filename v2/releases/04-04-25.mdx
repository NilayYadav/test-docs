  ## Unlocking New Possibilities on Beam

  We're excited to announce significant updates that enhance your experience on Beam, focusing on flexibility, compatibility, and overall stability. These changes are designed to make it easier for you to leverage the power of Beam without barriers.

  ## Improvements

  * Introducing Beam Pod: Deploy serverless containers as a service without refactoring your code to fit Beam's syntax. This innovation allows you to bring your own container images or host generic web servers seamlessly on Beam, opening up new avenues for customization and integration.
  
  ## Bug fixes

  * Resolved the Triton/LLVM compatibility issue: We've fixed the errors that occurred when running popular libraries and models like UnSloth and SGLang on Beam. This update ensures smoother execution and enhanced support for a wider range of applications, making Beam more versatile and reliable.
